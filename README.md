# Running

> [!WARNING]
> Refresh is a work-in-progress. Expect things to break, and things to be unsupported. What does work is fairly stable, though.

1. [View the latest releases](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh/releases)
1. Click the "assets" dropdown on the top-most release.
1. Download the artifact for your OS, extract it somewhere most convenient to you, and run it!

To update, you can simply repeat this process, overwriting the previous files.
In the future updates can (optionally) be handled by Refresh itself.
