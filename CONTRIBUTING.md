# New Contributor's Survival Guide

This document details the steps and other important information on how to contribute to Refresh. Feel free to skip sections if you believe you're already set.

## Requirements:
- Basic knowledge of [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/)
- Ability to work with [Realm](https://realm.io) if necessary
- Basic knowledge of "reverse engineering," specifically reading packet captures and (rarely) reading the game executable for the LBP series.

## Software prerequisites
- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- An IDE that supports .NET; Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, it's up to you!
- Any legally acquired PS3 or PSV LBP game, excluding Karting.
- Access to [HEN](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/tutorial-ps3hen-the-great-ps3-hen-all-in-one-guide.24369/)/CFW (PS3), [Henkaku/Enso](https://vita.hacks.guide) (PSV), and/or [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net) (PS3 on PC).

# Preparing your system
In order to use Git you must set up your configuration, this should ideally match your GitHub account's name and email. 

You can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or the IDE of your choice to help you with this! **Or if you're more technically inclined**, follow the CLI instructions below.

This will modify the **global** config, which will allow you to contribute to multiple projects with the same name and email with ease.

`$ git config --global user.name Your Name`

`$ git config --global user.email you@example.com`

# Preparing your new development environment
It's almost time to clone Refresh! Create a fork by pressing the "Fork" button at the base of this repository.

Afterwards, open a terminal to your working directory and clone the new fork using Git.

This is usually done with the following command:
` $ git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/Refresh.git`

Now, open the folder/workspace/solution with the IDE you chose. Explore the codebase, experiment, and have fun!

To run the server software in **DEBUG** mode, simply write:

`$ dotnet run --project Refresh.GameServer`

Or use your IDE to do this for you! 

Make sure to add [the upstream Refresh repository](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh) as the "**upstream**" remote using your IDE or GitHub Desktop. Happy hunting!
